The SplashScreen library is designed to allow any PNG file to be used as the
source for a splash screen.

PNG support is provided by a libpng (http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.h).
The version here is based on version 1.6.17 and is stripped down to only include
basic read support.  Patches to the core files are in libpng.patch.  Additional
library code needed by libpng but not provided by EDK is defined in limits.h,
setjmp.h, stddef.h, stdlib.h, string.h and windows.h.  The actual implementation
of these is in compat.c.  The unneeded files, listed below, have been removed:
